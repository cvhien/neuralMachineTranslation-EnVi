at Iran

When Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel
this week in retaliation for the Israeli assassinations of the
Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, some were surprised by
Tehran’s forceful response. Sentence 1.

 Coming Home with Mindfulness 

When we stop the busyness of the mind and come back to ourselves, our
suffering can seem very intense. This is because we are so used to
ignoring it and distracting ourselves from the pain.
With distractions,
we may succeed in numbing ourselves for a little while,
but the suffering inside wants our attention and it will fester and churn away
until it gets it. 

That’s why the first practice is to stop running, come home to our
bodies, and recognize our feelings of suffering—our anger,
our anxiety, our fear. Suffering is one energy. Mindfulness is another energy that we
can call on to embrace the suffering. The function of mindfulness is
first to recognize the suffering and then to embrace it.
